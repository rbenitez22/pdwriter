# pdwriter
Helper Classes to demonstrate how to write large strings of text(paragraphs) that get automatically wrapped within the page margins, as well as how to write HTML to PDF, using the Apache project PDFBox.

A jar is available in the deliverables folder. The directory /pdwriter/lib contains the dependencies (jsoup,sac, cssparser, and pdfbox-app-2.0.1.jar).  The **data-factory** jar  as well as **hamcrest** and **Junit** are also required for unit testing with JUnit.

The file PdWriter-Demo.pdf also contains a demonstration of the project's output.  Add the pdwriter-x.x.x.x.jar, as well as the runtime dependencies to use this code in your own project, or simply browse the code and take what you need.
